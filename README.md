# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Projects Collection

This repository contains three practical machine learning projects focused on real-world classification problems:

1. [Credit Card Fraud Detection](#1-credit-card-fraud-detection)
2. [Movie Genre Classification](#2-movie-genre-classification)
3. [Spam SMS Detection](#3-spam-sms-detection)

Each project demonstrates the end-to-end ML pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and inference.
